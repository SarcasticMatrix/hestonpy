hestonpy documentation
======================


The ``hestonpy`` Python package implements the **Heston** and **Baites** models for option **pricing**, **hedging** 
and robust **calibration** on implied volatilitiy smiles. 
The package also includes functionality for optimal portfolio allocation using stochastic control techniques.

Covered topics by the ``hestonpy`` package:

* Heston, Bates and BlackScholes models (path simulations, options pricing etc.).
* Calibration on implied volatility smile (from yahoo finance data, personnal data or syntethic data).
* De-noising market data (SVI implementation).
* Asset allocations (stochastic optimal control under Heston dynamics).
